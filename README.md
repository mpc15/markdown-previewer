# Markdown Previewer
##### _A Markdown previewer that allows you to see how content will display on a page when written in Markdown_
***

This is the repo for a markdown previewer I built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5. The goal was to have the previewer display Markdown language side-by-side with the polished website content.
